    <!--1.  If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.
That is, the element itself conveys some information about the type of content contained between the opening and closing tags.


2.  Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it, except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance).
Block
Takes up the full width available, with a new line before and after (display:block;)


display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', that however has the smallest possible width.
Inline
Takes up only as much width as it needs, and does not force new lines (display:inline;)

3.  What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Every box is composed of four parts (or areas), defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge. The content area, bounded by the content edge, contains the "real" content of the element, such as text, an image, or a video player.

4.  While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: align-items: center?
align-items: center; The flexbox items are aligned at the center of the cross axis. By default, the cross axis is vertical. This means the flexbox items will be centered vertically.
align-items always operates in the direction of the cross axis and justify-content operates in the direction of the main axis. So the way that these 2 relate is that they work perpendicularly to each other. By default, the main axis starts off horizontal and the cross axis is vertical.

5.  Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
New code changes can be easily commited, version branches can be effortlessly compared and merged, and code can also be optimized to perform better.
One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase.
Distributed version control systems give developers flexibility and freedom by providing every collaborator with a copy of the entire repository at any time, including all branches (lines of work) and commits (saved points in history) on a developer's local machine.
